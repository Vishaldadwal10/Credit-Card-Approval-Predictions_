# Credit Card Approval Prediction

This project aims to predict credit card approval based on various applicant features using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information about applicants' personal and financial attributes, which are analyzed to make predictions about their creditworthiness.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Addressing missing values and encoding categorical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing correlations and understanding feature importance.
- Model Training: Implementation of multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizing Randomized Search to optimize model parameters.
- Performance Evaluation: Generating classification reports, confusion matrices, and accuracy scores.

## Results

- Achieved an accuracy of approximately XX% (replace with actual value) with the best-performing model.
- Detailed performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 scores, highlight the model's effectiveness in predicting credit card approvals.

## Skills Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
